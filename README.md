## Outline / Notes

*  Considering this is the first lab encompassing what it is they student learned up to this point in this unit, I think we can make this one slightly easier considering there are scheduled to be two more labs after this one.  
* Maybe it's something like this [lab](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/swift-viewLifeCycle-lab) but not as difficult.  
* Free to explore ideas or fun projects the student can take on at this point.
